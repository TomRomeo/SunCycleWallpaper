# SunCycleWallpaper

A simple Python script to change the wallpaper in a GNOME desktop environment with location-based real-time sunrise/sunset data.

![Demonstration](demo.gif)

## Getting Started

Tested with Python 3.6.7 and GNOME Shell 3.28.3. Uses the `gsettings` command to change the wallpaper.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `requests` module installed for Python 3.

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install requests
```

### Installation

1. Get four wallpapers -- one each for dusk, dawn, day and night.
2. Grab `SunCycleChanger.py` and put it anywhere on your system (preferably somewhere in the user filesystem).
3. Edit the shebang on line 1 to point to your Python executable (e.g. `/usr/bin/python3`).
4. Edit lines 17-20 in the script to point to your desired wallpapers.
5. Create a file to store sunrise/sunset and location data (e.g. `touch SunCycleData.txt`) and edit line 21 in the script to point to that file.
6. Make `SunCycleChanger.py` executable (e.g. `chmod +x /path/to/SunCycleChanger.py`)

The script is set to the following schedule:

- dawn wallpaper -- 45 min before sunrise to 30 min after sunrise
- day wallpaper -- 30 min after sunrise to 45 min before sunset
- dusk wallpaper -- 45 min before sunset to 30 min after sunset
- night wallpaper -- 30 min after sunset to 45 min before sunrise

To change this schedule, edit lines 160-163 in the script as desired.

### Automation

Although the ideal way to run the script every five minutes would be with cron, there are lots of issues with permissions and environment variables I have yet to solve.

For now, the simplest way to automate running the script is to open Startup Applications and add the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "sleep 5 && while true; do /path/to/SunCycleChanger.py ; sleep 300; done"
```
